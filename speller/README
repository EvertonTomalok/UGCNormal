HOW TO USE:
- Extracting word frequency from text files before spelling checking:
./spell -train <TEXT-FILE>

- Getting word frequency from a list (./lexicos/regra+cb_freq.txt):
./spell -stat ./lexicos/regra+cb_freq.txt

- To run in no interactive mode:
echo 'word' | ./spell.pl -stat ./lexicos/regra+cb_freq.txt

- Spell-check a file
./spell -stat ./lexicos/regra+cb_freq.txt -f input_file.txt

- Spell-check files in a dir => it generates a new dir at DIR_PATH/checked
./spell -stat ./lexicos/regra+cb_freq.txt -d DIR_PATH


::DIRS
- data: data and scripts related to experiments
